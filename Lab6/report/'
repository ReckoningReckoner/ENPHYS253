\section{Procedure}

\end{figure}
The static apparatus in figure~\ref{fig:staticapparatus} was set up. The
micrometer (each subdivision representing 10 \si{\micro\meter}) was adjusted so
that the bubble level was centered, and the micrometer reading was recorded as
the zero value.  The length of the wire was measured with a two-meter stick by
summing the distances from the halfway point of the wire to the ceiling and to
the and contact point. The width of the wire was measured by a different
micrometer at three points and was averaged. A 100 gram weight was added to the
pan and the micrometer was readjusted so that the bubble level was centered. The
new micrometer reading and the added weight (not including the initial kilogram)
were recorded. The change length for the wire is the zero value subtracted from
the micrometer reading.  This process was repeated until the sum of added
weights reached 1000 grams.  Weights were then removed 50 grams at a time until
only the initial 1kg weight was left.  After each removal, the same process of
adjusting the micrometer and recording the measurements was repeated.  The
uncertainty in the weights were considered negligible, and the uncertainty in
the micrometer reading was half the smallest measurement. The largest source of
error was in the bubble level, as there is no way to precisely center it.

    \caption{Static Apparatus Diagram}\label{fig:dynamicapparatus}
\end{figure}
The dynamic apparatus in figure~\ref{fig:dynamicapparatus} was set up and the
oscilloscope and accelerometer power source turned on. The power wires in the
accelerometer have slack, allowing that when the mass to oscillate freely. The
mass was firmly struck with the mallet, creating a voltage reading on the
oscilloscope. After the accelerometer readings had stabilized into a simple
harmonic waveform, the oscilloscope signal was frozen. The horizontal cursors in
the oscilloscope were used to measure the pk-pk voltage amplitude of the wave,
and the vertical cursors were used to measure the time between ten full periods.
The voltage and time readings were recorded. This process was repeated two more
times. The mass was struck again, but the oscilloscope was frozen after the
reading had started damping. The horizontal cursors were used to find the points
where the pk-pk amplitudes had dampened by a factor of one half, and the
vertical cursors were used to find the time difference. The time difference was
recorded.  This process was repeated two more times for the same change in
amplitude.  Since the voltage and time measurements were taken multiple times,
their uncertainty is their standard error of the mean.

\section{Results and Analysis}
The static apparatus load data from table~\ref{tab:increasing} and
table~\ref{tab:decreasing} was plotted onto figure~\ref{fig:static} and a linear
regression was performed.  The slopes were determined to be \slopeIncrease~and
\slopeDecrease, which are identical within experimental error. Residual plots
were created on figures~\ref{fig:decreaseresidual}
and~\ref{fig:increaseresidual}, with both having no discernible pattern. The two
datasets were combined and plotted onto figure~\ref{fig:combined}, while the
residuals were plotted onto figure~\ref{fig:combinedresidual}. The slope from
the linear regression was determined to be~\slope. This slope was used with
equation~\ref{eq:Estatic} to calculate the Young's modulus of the stainless
steel wire as~\Estatic, agreeing with the accepted range of Young's modulus of
stainless steel of $180 \si{\giga\pascal}$ to $200
\si{\giga\pascal}$\cite{ref:young}. Using the second-last data point in
table~\ref{tab:increasing} with equation~\ref{eq:Estatic}, the maximum stress
was calculated as~\stressMax~and the maximum strain was calculated
as~\strainMax.

The dynamic apparatus time data from table~\ref{tab:dynamic} was used to
calculate the average frequency of oscillate as as~\freq, and was used with
equation~\ref{eq:Edynamic} to determine the Young's modulus for stainless steel
as~\Edynamic. This value also lies within the expected range of $180
\si{\giga\pascal}$ to $200 \si{\giga\pascal}$\cite{ref:young}. By calculating
the average voltage as \voltage~with the chip sensitivity of~\sensitivity, the
maximum acceleration of the mass was calculated as~\acceleration. From
equation~\ref{eq:Tension}, it was determined that the maximum tension in the
wire occurred when the magnitude of the acceleration was at a maximum and its
direction opposed gravity. The maximum tension was calculated as~\Tension,
resulting in a maximum stress of \stressMaxDynamic. The max acceleration was
also be used with equation~\ref{eq:oscillation} to determine the amplitude of
vibration $x_o$. Since the acceleration was a maximum, the cosine term equalled
1, making it possible to calculate \xo. Knowing that the maximum strain occurs
at $x_o$, it was calculated as \strainMaxDynamic. The times it took for the
amplitude to decrease by a factor of 0.5 from table~\ref{tab:half} was averaged
and used with equation~\ref{eq:Q} in order to calculate the quality factor as
\Q.

\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Equation List} 
\subsubsection{Static Case}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Estatic}
    E = \frac{stress}{strain} = \frac{F l}{A \Delta l} = \frac{mgl}{A\Delta l}
\end{equation}
$E$ is Young's modulus, $F$ is the tensile force acting over the cross sectional
area $A$, $l$ is the length, $\Delta l$ is the change in length, $m$ is mass and
$g$ is gravitational acceleration.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Case}
$T$ is the tension in the wire. These are the forces acting upon the mass.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Edynamic}
    E = {(2\pi f_{avg})}^2 Ml/A
\end{equation}
$f_{avg}$ is the frequency of oscillation, $M$ is the mass.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Tension}
    M\ddot{x} = T - Mg
\end{equation}
$\ddot{x}$ is the acceleration of the mass, $T$ is the tension in the wire. These
are the forces acting upon the mass.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oscillation}
    \ddot{x} = -{(2\pi f)}^2 x_o \cos(2\pi ft + \phi)
\end{equation}
$t$ is time, $x_o$ is the amplitude of vibration.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Q}
    Q = \pi t_{1/2}f/\ln(2)
\end{equation}
$Q$ is the quality factor, $t_{1/2}$ is time for the amplitude to decay by a
factor of 1/2.
